## First Paper: Transparency Talk Among Candidates for Public Office 
### [under review]
*How common are invocations and promises of transparency and open government among candidates for municipal office? And does “transparency talk” translate into the “walk” of transparency policy enactment?* This study is an inaugural mapping and descriptive  analysis of transparency talk among candidates for elected office.  Our primary objective is to ascertain whether the same socioeconomic and demographic conditions commonly associated with transparency compliance and performance – as conveyed by the voluminous literature on municipal transparency – also hold for transparency talk. Drawing on 39,454 pledges from mayoral candidates across Brazil’s 5,571 municipalities, our analysis a) finds that transparency talk has increased exponentially over time but diminishingly translates into policy enactment; and b) confirms associations between transparency talk and compliance/performance, butperformance but stresses the effect of candidate-level variables (e.g. age and gender). – particularly age and gender. This last result enjoins a reconsideration of the demographic attributes of candidates for public office.
